I had a friend from Congo who spoke the swahili and he kept saying Asante very often, until I eventually came to understand what that means: 'thank you' in english, all that cought my attention enough to wanting to learn the language, it sounded to be a language filled with respecting phrases.

                    <li>The Castle of Good Hope is the oldest surviving structure in South Africa with incredible history.</li>
                    <li>The construction of the castle started in 1666 and finally completed in 1679. The castle has stood for more than three centuries, surviving through wars and terrible weather.</li>
                    <li>Hundreds of people were imprisoned here during the Second Boer War and the jail cells were never removed. Today, tourists can browse through the cells to learn of its past prisoners’ poor conditions.</li>

                    <li>The City Hall and Grand Parade are adjacent to the Castle of Good Hope, also a historic and very interesting landmark.</li>
                    <li>The Hall itself is made up of components from all over the world. The honey-coloured stone, which makes up its façade of limestone, was imported from Bath in England.</li>
                    <li>City Hall, as its name suggests, was built to function as the centre of city administration and as such housed the offices of the City of Cape Town. These have since moved to the Cape Town Civic Centre.</li>

                    <li>Running all the way from the Cape Town Convention Centre, cutting through the middle of the CBD, and ending at Kloof Street, Long Street is a major part of the city’s street culture.</li>
                    <li>The shopping. From high-end boutiques such as A-List all the way to quirky second hand clothing stores such as Second Time Around, trendy urban shops such as Swag and the nearby Greenmarket Square, Long Street is a shopper’s paradise.</li>
                    <li>The vibe. Above all else, what sets this long, vibrant street aside is its atmosphere.</li>
